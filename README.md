# Zookeeper 
a Zoo animal catalog

### User Story
As a user I need a web app to keep track of my Zoo. When I load the web page I should be presented with options to Biew Animals at the Zoo, View Zookeepers. I should also have the option to Enter an Animal or Enter a Zookeeper. When I view animals I should see a list of cards with each animal, their species, diet and personality traits. There should be a side bar filter where I can filter animals by diet or personaility traits. When I view all Zookeepers I am presented with a list cards displaying the zookeeper's name, age and favorite animal. I should also have a sidebar to search by name or age.
